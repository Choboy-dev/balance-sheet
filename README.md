# Balance Sheet

## Overview

The Balance Sheet project is a financial reporting tool designed to present a company's assets, liabilities, and net worth over multiple years. This project uses HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and informative representation of financial data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## How I Built This Project

### HTML Structure

The project's HTML structure is organized into sections that represent different aspects of a company's financial data:

- **Company Information**: The project starts with a title that combines the company name and "Balance Sheet" to give a clear context.

- **Year Selector**: There's a hidden year selector (`<div id="years">`) that allows users to switch between different years of financial data.

- **Tables**: The heart of the project consists of three tables for displaying assets, liabilities, and net worth. Each table contains rows and columns to represent financial categories and values.

### CSS Styling

The CSS styles applied to this project not only make it visually appealing but also enhance the accessibility and usability of the financial data:

- **Hidden Text**: Elements with class `sr-only` are used to provide screen reader users with important information while keeping the text visually hidden.

- **Layout and Typography**: The project's layout is responsive and centered. Typography choices are made for readability and visual hierarchy.

- **Sticky Year Selector**: The year selector sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls for easy access to different years of financial data.

- **Data Presentation**: Data rows are visually distinguished from headers, and descriptions are included for better context.

## Lessons Learned

Working on this project has provided me with valuable insights and skills in:

- Structuring HTML for financial reporting.
- Styling and formatting tables for clear data presentation.
- Enhancing accessibility by providing hidden text for screen readers.
- Creating a responsive and visually pleasing layout.

I have also gained a deeper understanding of financial reporting concepts through this project.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding interactive features, such as the ability to toggle between different companies and compare their financial data side by side. Additionally, I aim to incorporate charts and graphs for a more visual representation of the financial information.
